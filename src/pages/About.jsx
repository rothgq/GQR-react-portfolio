      <p>
        I am a junior developer who has experience with front end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end development using Node.js utilizing packages such as Express.js, sequelize, and handlebars.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of those experiences culminated in mastering React and MongoDB, specifically utilizing Mongoose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior work consisted of operational management for the store-front, as well as project management, where I led multiple teams in conjunction to see timely results for remodels, reconstruction, or grand-openings for differing locations of the business.
